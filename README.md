# java-todolist-gui
## A swing gui with a sqlite database using the sormula ORM

Run the python script first with:

python setup_db.py

this will initialise the database with some example data

This java application uses a Swing GUI to present a user interface for users to create, delete and mark tasks as completed.
A task belongs to one section, whereas a section can have many tasks. 

For this project I chose to use the Sormula ORM to give me experience working with external libraries in Java and to see how an Object Orientated Programming language can work with a relational database, however if I were to do this again I would like to use the Hibernate ORM.
